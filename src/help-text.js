    flexDirection: "<b>flex-direction</b> sets the direction of the container's main axis and determines the direction in which items will be positioned.<br><b>row</b> means items will be placed in the same manner as inline elements (typically left to right in Latin-based languages).<br><b>column</b> means items will be positioned in the same manner as block elements (typically downwards in Latin-based languages).",

    justifyContent: "<b>justify-content</b> specifies how flex items are distributed along the main axis.<br><b>flex-start</b> and <b>flex-end</b> place items at the start and end, respectively, of the main axis.<br><b>center</b> places items in the center.<br><b>space-around</b> adds equal sized gaps before and after each item.<br><b>space-between</b> places the first and last item of each line at the start and end of the line and distributes the remaining space evenly.<br>(<b>space-evenly</b> is not part of the spec, but creates an equal size space between the line start and first item, between each item and between the last item and the line end.)",
    alignItems: "<b>align-items</b> specifies how items are aligned about the main-axis. If <b>flex-direction</b> is <b>row</b>, items are aligned vertically within the row.

    alignSelf: "<b>align-self</b> specifies how a single flex item is aligned about the main-axis. It's similar to <b>align-items</b> but applies to a single flex item."
